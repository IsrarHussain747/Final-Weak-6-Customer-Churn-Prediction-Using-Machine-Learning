Project Title:Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of various customer attributes, including demographic details, service subscriptions, and billing information. The goal is to develop a predictive model that helps identify customers likely to churn, allowing the company to take proactive retention measures.

Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: The dataset contains missing values in the TotalCharges column, which are replaced with the median value to ensure data consistency.
Feature Engineering:
The categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding to convert them into a format suitable for machine learning models.
The Churn column, originally categorical, is converted into a binary format (Yes → 1, No → 0).
Feature Scaling: Numerical features are standardized using StandardScaler to improve model performance.
Model Implementation
Two powerful classification models are implemented:

Random Forest Classifier: A robust ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
XGBoost Classifier: A gradient boosting technique known for its efficiency and high performance in classification tasks.
Model Evaluation
The models are assessed based on key performance metrics:

Accuracy: Measures overall correctness of predictions.
F1-Score: Balances precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced data.
ROC-AUC Score: Evaluates the model’s ability to distinguish between churn and non-churn customers.
Classification Report: Provides a detailed breakdown of precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning
A GridSearchCV approach is used to fine-tune the Random Forest model by optimizing key parameters such as n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples_split, ensuring the best predictive performance.

Feature Importance Analysis
The Random Forest feature importance is visualized to identify the most influential factors contributing to customer churn. This analysis helps in understanding customer behavior and formulating targeted retention strategies.

Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive machine learning solution for customer churn prediction. By leveraging data preprocessing, feature engineering, and powerful classification models, it offers valuable insights into customer retention. The feature importance analysis further enables businesses to focus on key drivers of churn and improve customer engagement strategies.
