Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major concern for businesses, especially in the telecom industry. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on various customer attributes, including demographic details, service subscriptions, and billing information. By accurately identifying customers at risk of churning, businesses can take proactive measures to improve customer retention.

🗂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from a telecom company and includes the following:

Customer Demographics (e.g., gender, senior citizen status)

Subscription Details (e.g., contract type, internet service type)

Billing Information (e.g., monthly charges, total charges)

Churn Status (Target variable: Yes/No, indicating if a customer has churned)

⚙️ Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values: The TotalCharges column had missing values, which were replaced with the median.

Feature Engineering:

The Churn column was converted into binary values (Yes → 1, No → 0).

Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding.

Feature Scaling:

Numerical columns were standardized using StandardScaler to improve model performance.

🏗 Model Implementation

Two machine learning models were implemented to predict customer churn:

Random Forest Classifier: A powerful ensemble learning method that improves accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.

XGBoost Classifier: An efficient gradient boosting algorithm that enhances performance and handles imbalanced data well.

📊 Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated based on multiple performance metrics:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.

F1-Score: Balances precision and recall, important for handling class imbalance.

ROC-AUC Score: Measures the model’s ability to distinguish between churn and non-churn customers.

Classification Report: Provides detailed metrics for both classes.

🔍 Hyperparameter Tuning

The Random Forest model was optimized using GridSearchCV to fine-tune parameters such as:

n_estimators: Number of trees in the forest.

max_depth: Maximum depth of each tree.

min_samples_split: Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.

📌 Feature Importance Analysis

The Random Forest feature importance analysis identified key factors influencing customer churn. This insight helps businesses focus on important attributes and develop effective retention strategies.

📈 Results and Insights

Both Random Forest and XGBoost performed well in predicting customer churn.

Feature importance analysis highlighted that contract type, total charges, and monthly charges are among the top factors influencing churn.

The fine-tuned Random Forest model achieved higher accuracy after hyperparameter optimization.
